== sproutcore 0.9.15

- Added titleize() helper for Strings.  Also imported various other helpers
  from Prototype.
  
- Ajax requests sent by SproutCore's SC.Server object will now add a custom
  header "SproutCore-Version: 1.0" to every request.  You can use this to 
  detect requests coming from SproutCore on the server side. Fixes #85 [trek]
  
- SC.Record does a better job of matching null values.  Fixed #96 [Fredrik 
  Blomqvist]

- SC.Server now handles created records with no attributes yet.  Fixed #98 
  [CAJ]

- Added support for reduced properties.  These properties begin with "@" and
  will automatically calculate some kind of summary information about the 
  receiving array.  They are also bindable so you can bind to myArray.@average
  and it will update whenever the average changes. [CAJ]
  
- Cleaned up SC.Array support to incorporate new SC.Enumerable functions.  The
  Enumerable methods from Prototype are no longer supported. [CAJ]
  
- Removed Array.asArray().  This helper has been deprecated for 6mo now.  Use
  SC.$A() or Array.from() instead.  [CAJ]
  
- Added SC.$A() helper.  This works like Prototype's SC.$A() except that it 
  will work with any enumerable.  It is also namespaced properly. [CAJ]
  
- Added "application/json" to the default Accept header for all servers.
  Required for proper support of json format. [Lawrence Pit]
  
- Added experimental support for SC.RailsServer which works with resource
  oriented Rails applications.  [Lawrence Pit, Simon Harris]
  
- [FIX] SplitView now resizes in both directions properly.  Closes #110 
  [Christoph Angerer]
  
- Added support for the SC.Enumerable mixin and SC.Enumerators.  These items
  provide the basis for our standard enumeration API.  This will replace 
  relying on iterators provided by Prototype eventually.  See docs on those
  classes for full information. [CAJ]
  
- SC.guidFor() now works consistantly with strings, numbers and other 
  primitive objects.  Before it would differentiate between different 
  instances of these objects.  Now it treats them the same if they are the 
  same value. [CAJ]

- Added SC.hashFor() method which can be used to determine if two objects are
  equal.  Normally this returns the same value as guidFor() but if you
  implement the hash() method on your object, it will return that value
  instead.  This gives you an easy way to indicate that two objects are 
  equal even if they are different instances. [CAJ]
  
- Updated SC.isEqual() to respect SC.hashFor().

- Added support for hasSelection, hasContent, and other useful properties on
  controllers for activating UI.
  
- Added newObject() and insertNewObjectAt() methods to ArrayController.  These
  methods will create and register new records automatically.
  
- SC.Record's changeCount now increments whenever a member array's attributes 
  change.
  
- Optimized SC.Object.objectForPropertyPath() to use less memory.

- You can now pass a string path as a :target and it will be converted to an
  object. (thanks Peter Blazejewicz!)
  
- SC.CollectionView will now call destroyObject on the content array instead 
  of removeObject if that method is defined.  This allows you to implement 
  arrays with a more specific handling of the destroyObject method.

- Added support for checkbox views in ListItemViews.  Since this is a fairly
  common requirement, checkbox views are now built in.

== sproutcore 0.9.14

- Fixed bug in SC.SourceListView that could incorrectly hide groups. Closes 
  #57. (Thanks mguymon)

- Fixed bug in SC.ObjectController that would sometimes not commit all pending
  changes because the model object would clear the changes hash.  Also a test
  for this was added.  Closes #66.  (Thanks YoNoSoyTu!)
  
- default index.html now has text/javascript added to script tags. Closes #71
- server.js now handles namespaced prefixes. Closes #74

- label_view now defaults to the span tag.  Closes #75.  (Thanks Erich!)

- Added support for posting data in both URL-encoded and JSON formats via
  SC.server.  This makes for a much cleaner round-trip.  To use this, set the
  postFormat: property to SC.JSON_FORMAT in SC.server.  Closes #49. 
  (Thanks Mauris Lamers!)
  
- The newRecord property is now set to false once a record has been 
  successfully sent back to the server.  A new internal property tracks when 
  you are waiting on a record to be created on the server and refuses to 
  submit it a second time. Closes #81 (Thanks Gareth!)
  
- All internal calls for arguments.callee.base.apply() have now been switched 
  to sc_super().  This means you MUST use version 0.9.13 or later of the build 
  tools to work with the javascript.

- Fixed a memory leak in IE that was caused by a self-reference to document. 
  (Thanks Juan)

- Improved documentation for a variety of classes. (Thanks gskluzacek)

- SC.Server can now handled nested Server prefixes in case you have 
  multi-level namespaces.

== sproutcore 0.9.12

- SC.ButtonView & SC.MenuItemView now removes and adds the 'active' class name
  on mouseExited and mouseEntered when the mouse is pressed to provide better 
  indication of whether an action will occur on mouse up. (Thanks schwa23)

- SC.Record#toString now shows record type in description.

- [FIX] SC.Timer now computes the next fire time before it executes your 
  callback action.  This should avoid the situation where a timer would call 
  your action, which would then take it past the last time it should fire and 
  hence the last fire would never happen. (Thanks August)

- [FIX] SC.Record#matchCondition() did not behave correctly when comparing 
  record instances.  Fix by onitunes includes both a faster comparison method 
  along with correct behavior + kickin' unit tests

- [FIX] some settings on the inline editor for multi-line edits were wrong.  
  Now fixed thanks to maloninc (#38)

== sproutcore 0.9.11

- [FIX] innerFrame tests were failing.  Now working.

- Progress bar now shows 100% fill when set to indeterminate.  This should 
  make it easier to style an indeterminate appearance.
  
- Changed all references for window.location= to window.location.href=.  
  Improves IE compatibility.
  
- Cleaned JSLink warnings from animator.js

- Removed stray debugger statements (thanks august!)

- Fixed CSS issues with SC-theme that made buttons appear offset.  Now appears   
  correct in FF3 & Safari (thanks mde!)

- Added detect-browser script which can be included at the top of your page to 
  detect the current browser and platform.  Also includes an 
  SC.setupBodyClassNames method that you can call after the body tag has been
  declared that will add class names for the current browser and platform. 
 
- Added documentation for Function.property()
- Added documentation for SC.Error.
- Added documentation for SC.SegmentedView

== sproutcore-0.9.10

- SC.Platform.Firefox now returns 2 for any gecko browser that is not Firefox.

- set() and a variety of other methods now returns this instead of the set
value.  This makes it possible to do method chaining.

- Fixed typo in ().  Fixes #12

- Fixed #11

- Switch from transitional to strict DTD

- Replacement of window.location to window.location.href.

- Added default src to image_view (static_url('blank'))

- Fix  for view_helper view that was closing the element.

- sproutcore now treats space as a printable key instead of a function key.
    
- Added chainability to observer methods; improved docs
    
    set(), beginPropertyChanges(), endPropertyChanges() and a whole slew of 
    other methods now return this instead of void or the set value.  This 
    allows for method chainings jQuery style such as:
    
    contact.beginPropertyChanges()
      .set('firstName', 'Charles')
      .set('lastName', 'Jolley')
    .endPropertyChanges();

- auto select content of textarea when it's focused: this._isFocused is true 
  for textarea while false for text input in didBecomeFirstRespo
    
- scrollable#scrollViewToVisible now scrolls up and left.  This corrects a bug
  with keyboard control that would bust when you move up or left.

- Updated documentation on form

- Use Element instead of element for IE compatability in 
  Element.setClassName()
    
- Added SC.View#destroy() to remove views from internal caches. insertBefore, 
  removeChild, etc. also now return the view instance so you can chain them.

- Popup menu was setting the width on each of the child menu items in addition
  to itself. This had a huge performance impact with little ac
    
- Disabled the current behavior for the menu item view helper which parses the 
  shortcut before inserting it; now it simply passes the passe

- [FIX] Replaced url() calls with static_url() in CSS so that they will work 
  properly in build mode

- Cleanup in drag.js

- Adding href property to ButtonView for bindable functionality on href 
  attributes.

- Properly order drop targets so that nested targets appear first.

== 0.9.8

* [FIX] collection views now update group views appropriately.

* [IE] offsetParent and viewportOffset() are now IE compliant.

* [IE] innerFrame now returns the correct value for elements without 
  hasLayout.

* [IE] get styleWidth & styleHeight on a view will now return the same value
on all platforms.  The IE version would previously include padding and borders
even though it should include only the core width.

* [FIX] Unit tests could fail to execute in IE if they ended in a comment, 
  fixed unittest.js to avoid this problem.

* [FIX] TextFieldView could blank out content when you tabbed out of in.

== SproutCore 0.9.5

* Collection View now supports selectOnMouseDown which can be turned off to 
  provide better drag and drop behavior on SourceList.  SC.SourceListView now 
  turns this off by default.

* Requesting a resource that should be available in production mode while 
  running your server in dev mode will now work.  Bundles now build one 
  manifest per language/build_mode combination. 

* Initial changes to SampleControls to add a form-view demo.  None of the 
  controls are wired up yet.

* Added mongrel as a required dependency of SproutCore.  If you have something
like thin installed this is technically not required, but several people were
experiencing trouble installing the gem.

* Lots of Safari-specific features for Photos just to demo some of its 
  capabilities.  Client-side storage support is also provided but currently 
  does not save changes you make.

* SC.CollectionView now supports selectAll (Ctrl+A)

* SC.CollectionView now supports the delete key to remove items.  Also added 
  delegate methods to the collection view delegate to give you control over 
  how deletions happen.

* SC.window can now properly capture the backspace key in Firefox.  To 
  activate this feature you must declare SC.CAPTURE_BACKSPACE_KEY = YES in 
  your core.js file.  Capturing the backspace key will prevent the browser 
  from going to previous page when the user hits backspace, which can lead to 
  data loss. To capture this key, SC.window will directly set the 
  document.onkeypress handler.  

* SC.GridView now supports dropping ON items.
 
* SC.ListView now supports dropping ON items.

* Removed the try/catch() that was placed around property notifiers.  This is 
  not only faster but it will make it easier to debug these exceptions in 
  Firebug and IE.

* [FIX] SC.InlineTextFieldView was using the _frame property even though that
is used by a parent class.  Changed to _optframe

* Improved some documentation here and there.

* [FIX] SC.View will recache its frames when isVisibleInWindow changes.  This 
  will help to ensure we always have the correct dimensions when bringing 
  views on and offscreen. -- All unit tests now pass again.

* Improves Photos sample to include support for adding/deleting albums and 
  drag and drop into albums.

* Collection View now supports dropping items ON item views as well as 
  between them. 

* Collection Views now support a delegate object that can be used to control 
  drag and drop and selection behavior.  See 
  mixins/collection_view_delegate.js for a complete description of the new 
  methods.

* SC.ArrayController now supports the useControllersForContent property.  If
  set to YES, then getting an objectAt() will return a controller for the 
  value instead of the value itself.  This is useful for those times you are 
  using an array controller to manage a set of objects you want to control.  
  Previously this feature was always used by array controllers and could not 
  be disabled. This is now off by default.

* [FIX] SC.ArrayController and SC.ObjectController now will properly observe
their own content, even when the content is set on init.

== SproutCore 0.9.4

* [FIX] Build system now generates index.html files for client bundles, even 
if they do not include .rhtml resources.

* [FIX] Typos in the readme docs for the client generator.

* Added automaticOutletFor() that will cause a view to be configured 
automatically instead of forcing you to use an outlets array.  Useful for when
you are manually constructing your views.

* Initial changes required to eventually implement improved observer 
notification system.

* Improved documentation for a variety of classes

* [FIX] Only fixtures ending in ".js" will now be loaded.  This allows you to 
  include fixtures named .json or whatever and actually load them via XHR.

== SproutCore 0.9.3

* Basic changes to get IE working.  All non-view tests now pass and the doc 
  app and test runner both load and run in IE7.  Lots of visual fixes are 
  still required for the sc-theme as well as IE-specific perf optimization 
  and bug fixes.

* [BUG] Default template for both client and template included a stray comma 
  in their core.js file that breaks IE and Safari 2.  This is fixed in the 
  templates and in the clients included with the framework, though you will 
  need to make this change manually in your own apps.

* beginInlineEdit() and endInlineEdit() on SC.LabelView were renamed to comply
  with the SC.Editable protocol.  Use beginEditing() and commitEditing() or
  discardEditing() instead.

* Added SC.Editable mixin.  This provides a standard protocol for begining 
  and ending keyboard editing sessions on views.  SC.Editable is now used 
  by SC.LabelView, SC.ListItemView, SC.TextFieldView, and 
  SC.TextareaFieldView.

* Collection view now supports the default behavior to begin editing when you
  click on a selected item for a second time.  If you hit return it will also
  begin editing.  To support this, you must set contentValueIsEditable to YES 
  and implement beginEditing() on your item view. 

* Inline editor is now supported in both SC.ListItemView and SC.LabelView.

* Improved inline editor (now renamed SC.InlineTextFieldView for consistancy).
  The new editor can be used with basically any view now in addition to just 
  the label view.  It also automatically inherits the font size and style of 
  any underlying DOM element that you hand it.  To work with an inline editor 
  you will need to implement the InlineEditorDelegate (see documentation).

* Inline editor now displays with a fixed width and grows downward as you type
  instead of stretching out to the end.

* Added hello world sample app.

* Updated contacts sample app.  It is much nicer now.

* Add sproutcore freeze:gems command to freeze latest SproutCore in your local
  project.

* Updated copyright to 2008.

* Converted all uses of setTimeout() in the framework to use run loop instead.

* Added invokeLater() methods to both SC.Object and Function.  These 
  convenience methods will create a timer to execute a method or function at a 
  later time.  If you need to execute code later, instead of setTimeout, 
  consider using myObject.invokeLater(0, 'methodName') ;

* New SC.Timer class provides more efficient triggers for timeouts, etc.  The
  timer class now also has unit tests and really awesome docs.

* [FIX] offsetParent, frame, clippingFrame, and innerFrame would all sometimes
  return the wrong values in Firefox because of a bug that returns the wrong
  offsetLeft and offsetTop when a parent element has a border.

* Fixed all SC unit tests that were failing (now that I can run them again).

* Test Runner now has a "Rerun Current Test" button that will rerun the 
  current test.

* Added convenience method $I() (or SC.inspect()) - converts an object to a 
  hash and then displays its key/value pairs.  Useful for debugging.

* Fixed up test templates in generators so that they check for the presence
  of main() before trying to fix it up.  This was causing errors on new tests 
  when added to frameworks.

* [FIX] invokeWhile() was implemented on real Array objects but not on 
  SC.Array mixin.  This caused the controllers/controller test to fail.  Now 
  fixed.

* Updated test runner to use new SproutCore.

* [FIX] The JSDoc template will now try to group items based on their full 
  path, rather than just the top-most directory.  This means views stored 
  under views/buttons, for example, now appear in the group VIEWS/BUTTONS in 
  the UI.

* Moved the base class for collections, buttons, and fields into their 
  respective folders.  This will appear them to appear under the correct 
  location in the Doc viewer.

* [FIX] Grouped views in the source list without a visible header will 
  overlapping the following group, absorbing their clicks.  Now they render
  the proper size.

* SC.SliderView provides a horizontal slider.  No vertical slider is currently
planned since those controls are so rare.  If someone really needs one, please
enhance SC.SliderView to support it!

* slider_view helper creates a slider view + html

* Add example to sample_controls

* Converted docs for drag modules to JSDoc format.

* SourceListGroupViews now automatically collapse their group title if the
group value is null.  Items will still be shown; they will just appear to be 
"top level"

* JSDocs template was cutting the first sentance from a class description. 
  This is now fixed.
 
* Updated sc_docs to work with updated SproutCore.  Also adopts new look and 
  feel and includes support for live search on all symbols defined in the 
  library (try it; it's cool - visit: http://localhost:4020/sproutcore/-docs)

* JSDoc template no longer generated highlighted JS source along with ref
  docs.  This was slowing things down and the output wasn't really that great
  anyway.

* Tweaked JSdoc's Textile support to accept '-' as a bullet characters.  Since
  jsdoc strips all * at the beginning of lines you could not do bulletted 
  lists before.  Now you can using -.

* Updated design of jsdoc documentation to make it easier to read.

* Renamed buttons-sprite.png to sc-theme-sprite.png. Added 
  sc-theme-ysprite.png.  One is now used to hold all repeat-x and non-
  repeating sprites while the other is used for repeat-y sprites only.

* SC.SplitView & SC.SplitDividerView provide support for draggable and 
  collapsable split views.

* SC.ListView now uses SC.ListItemView as its default example view instead of
  SC.LabelView (or the old SC.TextCellView)


* The Source List now provides support for the disclosure triangle.  A 
  disclosure is automatically shown if you have grouping enabled and you set 
  the groupVisibleKey property to anything other an null.  The disclosure 
  does not yet auto-reveal during a drag.

* SC.DisclosureView - Shows a disclosure triangle button.

* [FIX] Left over calls to SC.TextCellView.  Replaced with SC.LabelView.

* SC.WorkspaceView is now removed from the framework.  It was always intended
  for use in Sproutit applications and it is really too specific for such a 
  generic framework.

* SC.LabelView gets a new API!  Now in line with other SC.Control based
  classes.  Set value for the value, content/contentValueKey to display part
  of some content.

* You can add view helpers to your own projects just by dropping them into 
  a lib directory inside your framework or client.  If you need to load your
  view helpers in a certain order, use the view_helper() method.  See the 
  view helpers in SproutCore for an example usage.

* SproutCore view helpers are now stored in the framework itself along with
  the JavaScript.  This will make it easier to include the latest version of 
  the SproutCore framework in you app without having to install a new set of
  build tools.  This should basically eliminate the only frequently changing 
  part of the build tools.

* SC.SourceList and SC.ListItemView properties now use "content..Key" 
  convention for naming properties.  If you have built code with the old
  "content..Property" conventions, you will need to update your code.

* Added hint property to text_area_view helper that is required to display 
  ghost text.

* added new SC.CheckboxView and SC.RadioView for creating simulated checkbox
  and radio buttons.  These buttons have more functions than their platform
  native counterparts including mixed style and full styling support.

* Moved field view subclasses to views/field directory.

* Added SC.Validatable mixin that can be applied to any view to make it work
  with validators.  SC.FieldView now incorporates this mixin.

* Now if you add initMixin() to a mixin, it will be called automatically 
  whenever an object that includes the mixin is instantiated.  You can use 
  this to perform any setup necessary for the mixin.

* Renamed SC.Control.contentValueProperty to SC.Control.contentValueKey to
  be consistent with the rest of the API.

* Added updateContentWithValueObserver to SC.Control that will relay changes
  to the value property back to the content object if you use the default 
  implementation.

* Changed SC.Control observers for various states that were once private to 
  public methods.  This way you can override them in your subclasses if you 
  need to perform some extra processing and you want to make sure you do them 
  in the right order.  You can also just add more observers as well.

* Added JSDoc info for Validators, SC.FieldView, SC.CheckboxFieldView

* Switched some Sc Theme CSS to use sc-button-view classname instead of more
  generic a.button or a.regular.

* Added new addClassName, removeClassName, setClassName and hasClassName
  methods on SC.View that are 7x faster than prototype's version.

* Integrated SC.Control into SC.ButtonView

* Changed SC.ButtonView.labelText and SC.ButtonView.labelSelector to 
  SC.ButtonView.title and SC.ButtonView.titleSelector to be more consistant 
  with current naming conventions.

* [FIX] Some doc tags were wrong in SC.ScrollView and others.

* Improved documentations on SC.ImageView.

* SC.ImageView now includes the SC.Control mixin and can accept either a 
CSS class name or a URL as its value.  This makes it easy to switch an image
from using a sprite to use a custom-generated image and back again.

* SproutCore now includes some shared standard icons that you can use in your
own application, courtesy of IconDrawer (http://www.icondrawer.com).

* Generalized SC.Control's observer so that you can now use it to observe
  changes to multiple properties on content.  This should capture a very 
  common pattern requires by collection item views.  Most control-list 
  SC.Views will eventually adopt this mixin.

* Added ListItemView which will be used for rendering content in list views 
  and source list views.  ListViewItem can render a name, icon, and optional
  unread count.

* Changed displayProperty in SC.CollectionView to contentValueKey to match 
  the new SC.Control pattern.

* SC.Control now has built in support for a value and content property.  The 
  value property is typically the value the control displays, while content 
  is an object that you might pull a content value from.  You can determine 
  the proeprty of the content object to use as a value by setting the 
  'contentValueKey'.  The contentValueKey can also be provided by the 
  displayDelegate.

* Added SC.DelegateSupport mixin that can be used to support the delegate 
  pattern.

* [FIX] Selection management would throw exception after a drag and drop.

* [FIX] Optimization in fmt() would through an exception if you passed it a
  value that did not support toString().

* Moved selection management methods from CollectionController in independent 
  SC.SelectionSupport mixin.  This mixin is now used by both 
  SC.CollectionController and SC.ArrayController so you can use either one to 
  manage a selection state.  You can also apply this mixin to your own 
  controllers to manage selection state if you like (though this is not 
  required to manage selections.)

* Began to separate CSS rules into a core.css and a theme.css.  The core.css 
  styles are generally required by SproutCore and should apply even if you 
  build your own theme.  The theme.css rules apply to the SproutCore theme 
  only and can be overriden by your own CSS.

* Added SC.SourceListView and sc-theme styles for source lists.  Source lists 
  support grouping if you enable this feature.  See the new Collections2 tab 
  in the SampleControls app for an example source list.

* Added SC.TableView.  This feature is in progress.    See the new 
  Collections2 tab in the SampleControls app for an example table view.

* Changed asHTML and asText properties to innerHTML and innerText to match 
  their DOM equivalents.

* Renamed SC.CollectionItem mixin to SC.Control mixin.  SC.Control mixin now 
  provides some standard functionality for all interactive controls such as 
  handling selection states, enabled and focus states.

* Removed support for :resize_options property in view helper, since 
  auto-resizing is no longer supported in SC.View (it never worked right 
  anyway and was not functionally very usable.)

* innerText property now uses TextNodes, making it about 50% faster than 
  innerHTML on FireFox.

* Added view helpers for list_view, scroll_view, grid_view, source_list_view, 
  and table_view.  Also refactored collection view helpers into their own 
  file.

* [FIX] CollectionView is now able to render items in groups.  

* [FIX] SC.ObjectController: Avoid unwanted commit when oldValue == null && 
  newValue == ''.
