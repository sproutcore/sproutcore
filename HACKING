SproutCore is an open source project aimed at helping people build great,
desktop-quality applications on the web without plugins.  If you would like
to help work on the SproutCore source code itself, this guide is for you.

GETTING STARTED

To work on your own version of sproutcore, it's quite easy to do.  Here is 
what we recommend:

1. Create a github account, if you do not have one already.
2. Visit the SproutCore source at http://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore and
   fork the source.  This will give you your own version.
3. In any application project, cd into your frameworks directory (create it 
   if it does not exist yet), and checkout your new source into a sproutcore
   directory.
4. Restart your sc-server if needed.

Now you will be working with your very own version of SproutCore.  You can 
make changes as you like and push them to your fork on github.  When you want
to submit those changes back to the main source, you can send us a pull 
request.

GUIDE TO THE SOURCE

SproutCore itself is being divided into three libraries:  

- SproutCore Foundation contains the low-level enabling technologies of   
  SprouCore such as key-value binding, the in memory database, general 
  controllers, and so on.  This section will tell you a little more about 
  where you can find various bits of code within sproutcore.
  
- SproutCore Desktop contains higher level views and other technologies for
  creating a large scale desktop-like application, such as list views, table
  views, and more.
  
- SproutCore Mobile contains higher level views and other technologies for 
  building an app that runs on a mobile phone such as the iPhone or Android.
  Unlike Desktop it is optimized for applications that will consume small 
  amounts of data and run on slower devices.
  
In addition to the above, you may also find the sproutcore-deprecated library
useful as it provides ongoing access to older API's no longer supported in 
SproutCore 1.0.

SPROUTCORE FOUNDATION

Within SproutCore Foundation, you will find the following directories in the
source.  Keep in mind that all of this source is combined into a single file
when your application is built:

system:
  This directory contains the low-level files concerned with starting an
  app and providing basic classes such as SC.Object.
  
mixins:
  This directory contains mixins and protocols you might include on other
  classes.
  
extensions:
  This directory contains extensions to built in objects such as Date and 
  String.
  
application:
  This directory contains files related to application-level support such as
  the run loop, responder management, SC.Application, and so on.
  
private:
  This directory contains classes that are used internally by SproutCore and
  not part of the public API
  
models:
  Core code to implement the model layer, including the in memory dtabase
  
controllers: 
  Core code to implement controllers.
