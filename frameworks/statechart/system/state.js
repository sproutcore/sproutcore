    Called by the statechart to allow a state to try and handle the given event. If the
    event is handled by the state then YES is returned, otherwise NO.
    
    There is a particular order in how an event is handled by a state:
    
      1) Basic function whose name matches the event
      2) Registered event handler that is associated with an event represented as a string
      3) Registered event handler that is associated with events matching a regular expression
      4) The unknownEvent function
      
    Use of event handlers that are associated with events matching a regular expression may
    incur a performance hit, so they should be used sparingly.
    
    The unknownEvent function is only invoked if the state has it, otherwise it is skipped. Note that
    you should be careful when using unknownEvent since it can be either abused or cause unexpected
    behavior.

  Extends the JS Function object with the handleEvents method that
  will provide more advanced event handling capabilities when constructing

  By default, when you add a method to a state, the state will react to 
  events that matches a method's name, like so:

  In some situations, it may be advantageous to use one method that can react to 
  multiple events instead of having multiple methods that essentially all do the
  same thing. In order to set a method to handle more than one event you use
  the handleEvents method which can be supplied a list of string and/or regular
  expressions. The following example demonstrates the use of handleEvents:
  
  {{{
  
    state = SC.State.extend({
    
      eventHandlerA: function(event, sender, context) {
      
      }.handleEvents('foo', 'bar'),
      
      eventHandlerB: function(event, sender, context) {
      
      }.handleEvents(/num\d/, 'decimal')
    
    })
  
  }}}
  
  Whenever events 'foo' and 'bar' are sent to the state, the method eventHandlerA
  will be invoked. When there is an event that matches the regular expression
  /num\d/ or the event is 'decimal' then eventHandlerB is invoked. In both 
  cases, the name of the event will be supplied to the event handler. 
  
  It should be noted that the use of regular expressions may impact performance
  since that statechart will not be able to fully optimize the event handling logic based
  on its use. Therefore the use of regular expression should be used sparingly.
