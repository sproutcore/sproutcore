  A container view will display its "content" view as its only child.  You can
  use a container view to easily swap out views on your page.  In addition to
  displaying the actual view in the content property, you can also set the 
  nowShowing property to the property path of a view in your page and the
  view will be found and swapped in for you.
  
  If you want to change the way the container view swaps in your new view, 
  override the replaceContent() method.
