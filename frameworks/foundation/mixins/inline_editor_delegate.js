/**
  @protocol
  
  This delegate is consulted by view implementing SC.InlineEditable and
  SC.InlineEditor and controls the lifecycle of the editor as well as begin
  notified of events in the editing process.
  
  By default it edits an SC.LabelView using an SC.InlineTextFieldView.

  All methods will be attempted to be called on the inlineEditorDelegate of the
  inlineEditor or inlineEditable first and then the target view if it didn't exist
  on the delegate. This allows you to implement default delegate handlers on your
  editable view.
