/** @class
  A Pane is like a regular view except that it does not need to live within a
  parent view.  You usually use a Pane to form the root of a view hierarchy in
  your application, such as your main application view or for floating
  palettes, popups, menus, etc.

  Usually you will not work directly with the SC.Pane class, but with one of
  its subclasses such as SC.MainPane, SC.Panel, or SC.PopupPane.

  ## Showing a Pane

  To make a pane visible, you need to add it to your HTML document.  The
  simplest way to do this is to call the append() method:

      myPane = SC.Pane.create();
      myPane.append(); // adds the pane to the document

  This will insert your pane into the end of your HTML document body, causing
  it to display on screen.  It will also register your pane with the
  SC.RootResponder for the document so you can start to receive keyboard,
  mouse, and touch events.

  If you need more specific control for where you pane appears in the
  document, you can use several other insertion methods such as appendTo(),
  prependTo(), before() and after().  These methods all take a an element to
  indicate where in your HTML document you would like you pane to be inserted.

  Once a pane is inserted into the document, it will be sized and positioned
  according to the layout you have specified.  It will then automatically
  resize with the window if needed, relaying resize notifications to children
  as well.

  ## Hiding a Pane

  When you are finished with a pane, you can hide the pane by calling the
  remove() method.  This method will actually remove the Pane from the
  document body, as well as deregistering it from the RootResponder so that it
  no longer receives events.

  The isVisibleInWindow method will also change to NO for the Pane and all of
  its childViews and the views will no longer have their updateDisplay methods
  called.

  You can readd a pane to the document again any time in the future by using
  any of the insertion methods defined in the previous section.

  ## Receiving Events

  Your pane and its child views will automatically receive any mouse or touch
  events as long as it is on the screen.  To receive keyboard events, however,
  you must focus the keyboard on your pane by calling makeKeyPane() on the
  pane itself.  This will cause the RootResponder to route keyboard events to
  your pane.  The pane, in turn, will route those events to its current
  keyView, if there is any.

  Note that all SC.Views (anything that implements SC.ClassicResponder,
  really) will be notified when it is about or gain or lose keyboard focus.
  These notifications are sent both when the view is made keyView of a
  particular pane and when the pane is made keyPane for the entire
  application.

  You can prevent your Pane from becoming key by setting the acceptsKeyPane
  to NO on the pane.  This is useful when creating palettes and other popups
  that should not steal keyboard control from another view.

    Attempts to send the specified event up the responder chain for this pane. This
    method is used by the RootResponder to correctly delegate mouse, touch and keyboard
    events. You can also use it to send your own events to the pane's responders, though
    you will usually not do this.

    A responder chain is a linked list of responders - mostly views - which are each
    sequentially given an opportunity to handle the event. The responder chain begins with
    the event's `target` view, and proceeds up the chain of parentViews (via the customizable
    nextResponder property) until it reaches the pane and its defaultResponder. You can
    specify the `target` responder; by default, it is the pane's current `firstResponder`
    (see SC.View keyboard event documentation for more on the first responder).

    Beginning with the target, each responder is given the chance to handle the named event.
    In order to handle an event, a responder must implement a method with the name of the
    event. For example, to handle the mouseDown event, expose a `mouseDown` method. If a
    responder handles a method, then the event will stop bubbling up the responder chain.
    (If your responder exposes a handler method but you do not always want to handle that
    method, you can signal that the method should continue bubbling up the responder chain by
    returning NO from your handler.)

    In some rare cases, you may want to only alert part of the responder chain. For example,
    SC.ScrollView uses this to capture a touch to give the user a moment to begin scrolling
    on otherwise-tappable controls. To accomplish this, pass a view (or responder) as the
    `untilResponder` argument. If the responder chain includes this view, it will break the
    chain there and not proceed. (Note that the `untilResponder` object will not be given a
    chance to respond to the event.)

    @param {String} action The name of the event (i.e. the method name) to invoke.
    @param {SC.Event} [evt] The event object.
    @param {SC.Responder} [responder] The first responder in the chain to check. If not specified, then the pane's currently designated `firstResponder` will be used instead.
    @param {SC.Responder} [untilResponder] If specified, the responder chain will break when this object is reached preventing it and subsequent responders in the chain from receiving the event.
    @returns {SC.Responder} The responder that handled the event
