/** @class SC.Touch
  Represents a touch. Single touch objects are passed to `touchStart`, `touchEnd` and `touchCancelled` event handlers;
  a specialized multitouch event object is sent to `touchesDragged`, which include access to all in-flight touches
  (see "The touchesDragged Multitouch Event Object" below).

  SC.Touch exposes a number of properties, including pageX/Y, clientX/Y, screenX/Y, and startX/Y (the values that
  pageX/Y had when the touch began, useful for calculating how far the touch has moved). It also exposes the touch's
  target element at `target`, its target SC.View at `targetView`, and the touch's unique identifier at `identifier`,
  which may be relied upon to identify a particular touch for the duration of its lifecycle.

  A touch object exists for the duration of the touch – literally for as long as your finger is on the screen – and
  is sent to a number of touch events on your views. Touch events are sent to the touch's current responder, set initially
  by checking the responder chain for views which implement `touchStart` (or `captureTouch`, see "Touch Events" below),
  and can be passed to other views as needed (see "Touch Responders" below).

  Touch Events
  -----
  You can use the following methods on your views to capture and handle touch events:

  - `captureTouch` -- Sometimes, a touch responder part way up the chain may need to capture the touch and prevent it
    from being made available to its childViews. The canonical use case for this behavior is SC.ScrollView, which by
    default captures touches and holds onto them for 150ms to see if the user is scrolling, only passing them on to
    children if not. (See SC.ScrollView#delaysContentTouches for more.) In order to support this use case, `captureTouch`
    bubbles the opposite way as usual: beginning with the target's pane and bubbling *down* towards the target itself.
    `captureTouch` is passed a single instance of `SC.Touch`, and must return YES if it wishes to capture the touch and
    become its responder. (If your view doesn't want to immediately capture the touch, but instead wants to suggest itself
    as a fallback handler in case the child view resigns respondership, it can do so by passing itself to the touch's
    `stackCandidateTouchResponder` method.)
  - `touchStart` -- When a touch begins, or when a new view responder is first given access to it (see "Touch Responders"
    below), the touch is passed to this method.
  - `touchesDragged` -- Whenever any touches move, the `touchesDragged` method is called on the current view responder
    for any touches that have changed. The method is provided two arguments: a special multitouch event object (see "The
    touchesDragged Multitouch Event Object" below), and an array containing all of the touches on that view. (This is
    the same as calling `touch.touchesForView(this)`.)
  - `touchEnd` -- When a touch is complete, its current responder's `touchEnd` handler is invoked, if present, and passed
    the touch object which is ending.
  - `touchCancelled` -- This method is generally only called if you have changed the touch's responder. See "Touch
    Responders" below; in brief, if you pass the touch to another responder via `makeTouchResponder`, fully resigning
    your touch respondership, you will receive a `touchCancelled` call for the next event; if you pass the touch to another
    responder via `stackNextTouchResponder`, and never receive it back, you will receive a `touchCancelled` call when the
    touch finishes. (Note that because RootResponder must call touchStart to determine if a view will accept respondership,
    touchStart is called on a new responder before touchCancelled is called on the outgoing one.)

  The touchesDragged Multitouch Event Object
  -----
  The specialized event object sent to `touchesDragged` includes access to all touches currently in flight. You can
  access the touches for a specific view from the `touchesForView` method, or get an average position of the touches
  on a view from the convenient `averagedTouchesForView` method. For your convenience when dealing with the common
  single-touch view, the `touchesDragged` event object also exposes the positional page, client, screen and start X/Y
  values from the *first touch*. If you are interested in handling more than one touch, or in handling an average of
  in-flight touches, you should ignore these values. (Note that this event object exposes an array of touch events at
  `touches`. These are the browser's raw touch events, and should be avoided or used with care.)

  Touch Responders: Passing Touches Around
  -----
  The touch responder is the view which is currently handling events for that touch. A touch may only have one responder
  at a time, though a view with `acceptsMultitouch: YES` may respond to more than one touch at a time.

  A view becomes a touch responder by implementing touchStart (and not returning NO). (Out-of-order views can capture
  touch responder status by implementing captureTouch and returning YES.) Once a view is a touch responder, only that
  view will receive subsequent `touchesDragged` and `touchEnd` events; these events do not bubble like mouse events, and
  they do *not* automatically switch to other views if the touch moves outside of its initial responder.

  In some situations, you will want to pass control on to another view during the course of a touch, for example if
  it goes over another view. To permanently pass respondership to another view:

      if (shouldPassTouch) {
        touch.makeTouchResponder(nextView);
      }

  This will trigger `touchStart` on the new responder, and `touchCancel` on the outgoing one. The new responder will begin
  receiving `touchesDragged` events in place of the outgoing one.

  If you want to pass respondership to another view, but are likely to want it back – for example, when a ScrollView
  passes respondership to a child view but expects that the child view will pass it back if it moves more than a certain
  amount:

    if (shouldTemporarlyPassTouch) {
      touch.stackNextTouchResponder(nextView);
    }

  This will trigger `touchStart` on the new responder, and it will start receiving `touchesDragged` and `touchEnd` events.
  Note that the previous responder will not receive `touchCancelled` immediately, since the touch may return to it before
  the end; instead, it will only receive `touchCancelled` when the touch is ended.

  (If you would like to add a view as a fallback responder without triggering unnecessary calls to its `touchStart` and
  `touchCancelled` events, for example as an alternative to returning YES from `captureTouch`, you can call
  `stackCandidateTouchResponder` instead.)

  When the child view decides that the touch has moved enough to be a scroll, it should pass touch respondership back
  to the scroll view with:

    if (Math.abs(touch.pageX - touch.startX) > 4) {
      touch.restoreLastTouchResponder();
    }

  This will trigger `touchCancelled` on the second responder, and the first one will begin receiving `touchDragged` events
  again.
