/**
  @class

  Represents a substate within a statechart.

  The statechart actively manages all substates belonging to it. When a substate
  is created, it immediately registers itself with it parent substates.

  You do not create an instance of a substate itself. The statechart manager will
  go through its state heirarchy and create the substates itself.

  For more information on using statecharts, see SC.StatechartManager.

    - If this state does not have any substates, then in addition to the

    - If this state is entered and its substates are concurrent, the added
      substate will not be entered.

    If this state is either entered or current and you'd like the added substate
    to take affect, you will need to explicitly reenter this state by calling
    its `reenter` method.

    Called by the statechart to allow a state to try and handle the given event. If the

    There is a particular order in how an event is handled by a state:

     1. Basic function whose name matches the event
     2. Registered event handler that is associated with an event represented as a string
     3. Registered event handler that is associated with events matching a regular expression
     4. The unknownEvent function

    Use of event handlers that are associated with events matching a regular expression may
    incur a performance hit, so they should be used sparingly.

    The unknownEvent function is only invoked if the state has it, otherwise it is skipped. Note that
    you should be careful when using unknownEvent since it can be either abused or cause unexpected
    behavior.

    Example of a state using all four event handling techniques:

        SC.State.extend({

          // event handler that handles events matching the regular expression /num\d/
          //   ex. num1, num2
          eventHandlerB: function (event, arg1, arg2) {
            ...

  /**
    Called whenever this state is to be entered during a state transition process. This
    is useful when you want the state to perform some initial set up procedures.

    If when entering the state you want to perform some kind of asynchronous action, such
    as an animation or fetching remote data, then you need to return an asynchronous
    action, which is done like so:

        enterState: function () {
          return this.performAsync('foo');
        }

    After returning an action to be performed asynchronously, the statechart will suspend
    the active state transition process. In order to resume the process, you must call
    this state's resumeGotoState method or the statechart's resumeGotoState. If no asynchronous
    action is to be perform, then nothing needs to be returned.

    When the enterState method is called, an optional context value may be supplied if
    one was provided to the gotoState method.

    In the case that the context being supplied is a state context object
    ({@link SC.StateRouteHandlerContext}), an optional `enterStateByRoute` method can be invoked
    on this state if the state has implemented the method. If `enterStateByRoute` is
    not part of this state then the `enterState` method will be invoked by default. The
    `enterStateByRoute` is simply a convenience method that helps removes checks to
    determine if the context provide is a state route context object.
