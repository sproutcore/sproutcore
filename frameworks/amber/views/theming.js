    that is responsible for rendering all views of a certain type. For example,
    you may want rendering of SC.ButtonView to be controlled by an object that

    RenderDelegate. In some cases, you may have a conflict between the RenderDelegate's
    API and your view's. For instance, you may have a 'value' property that is
    any number, but the render delegate expects a percentage. Make a 'displayValue'
    property, add _it_ to displayProperties instead of 'value', and the Render Delegate
    will automatically use that when it wants to find 'value.'
