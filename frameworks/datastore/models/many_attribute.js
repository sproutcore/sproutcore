/** @class

  ManyAttribute is a subclass of `RecordAttribute` and handles to-many
  relationships.

  When setting ( `.set()` ) the value of a `toMany` attribute, make sure
  to pass in an array of `SC.Record` objects.

  There are many ways you can configure a `ManyAttribute`:

      contacts: SC.Record.toMany('MyApp.Contact', {
        inverse: 'group', // set the key used to represent the inverse
        isMaster: YES|NO, // indicate whether changing this should dirty
        transform: function(), // transforms value <=> storeKey,
        isEditable: YES|NO, make editable or not,
        through: 'taggings' // set a relationship this goes through
      });

  @extends SC.RecordAttribute
  @since SproutCore 1.0
*/
SC.ManyAttribute = SC.RecordAttribute.extend(
  /** @scope SC.ManyAttribute.prototype */ {

  /**
    Set the foreign key on content objects that represent the inversion of
    this relationship. The inverse property should be a `toOne()` or
    `toMany()` relationship as well. Modifying this many array will modify
    the `inverse` property as well.

    @property {String}

  inverse: null,

  /**
    If `YES` then modifying this relationships will mark the owner record
    dirty. If set to `NO`, then modifying this relationship will not alter
    this record.  You should use this property only if you have an inverse
    property also set. Only one of the inverse relationships should be marked
    as master so you can control which record should be committed.
