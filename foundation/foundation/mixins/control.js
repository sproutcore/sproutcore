  A Control is a view that also implements some basic state functionality.
  Apply this mixin to any view that you want to have standard control
  functionality including showing a selected state, enabled state, focus
  state, etc.
  
  h2. About Values and Content
  
  Controls typically are used to represent a single value, such as a number,
  boolean or string.  The value a control is managing is typically stored in
  a "value" property.  You will typically use the value property when working
  with controls such as buttons and text fields in a form.
  
  An alternative way of working with a control is to use it to manage some
  specific aspect of a content object.  For example, you might use a label
  view control to display the "name" property of a Contact record.  This 
  approach is often necessary when using the control as part of a collection
  view.
  
  You can use the content-approach to work with a control by setting the 
  "content" and "contentValueKey" properties of the control.  The 
  "content" property is the content object you want to manage, while the 
  "contentValueKey" is the name of the property on the content object 
  you want the control to display.
  
  The default implementation of the Control mixin will essentially map the
  contentValueKey of a content object to the value property of the 
  control.  Thus if you are writing a custom control yourself, you can simply
  work with the value property and the content object support will come for
  free.  Just write an observer for the value property and update your 
  view accordingly.
  
  If you are working with a control that needs to display multiple aspects
  of a single content object (for example showing an icon and label), then
  you can override the contentValueDidChange() method instead of observing
  the value property.  This method will be called anytime _any_ property 
  on the content object changes.  You should use this method to check the
  properties you care about on the content object and update your view if 
  anything you care about has changed.
  
  h2. Delegate Support
  
  Controls can optionally get the contentDisplayProperty from a 
  displayDelegate, if it is set.  The displayDelegate is often used to 
  delegate common display-related configurations such as which content value
  to show.  Anytime your control is shown as part of a collection view, the
  collection view will be automatically set as its displayDelegate.

    and observable.  Changing this value will immediately change the
    appearance of the control.  Likewise, editing the control 
    will immediately change this value.
    
    If instead of setting a single value on a control, you would like to 
    set a content object and have the control display a single property

    In those cases, you can set the content and contentValueKey for the
    control.  This will cause the control to observe the content object for
    changes to the value property and then set the value of that property 
    on the "value" property of this object.
    
    Note that unless you are using this control as part of a form or

    the control directly to a controller property.
