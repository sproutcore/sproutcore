SproutCore JavaScript Application Framework
 
SproutCore is a framework for building desktop-like applications in the web without the use of plugins.  With SproutCore, you build rich, interactive
applications in the web in less code than most simple web pages require today.

The easiest way to get started with SproutCore is using the BlueRibbon build 
tools included with the SproutCore package when you install it from the Ruby 
Gems.  Please see the Getting Started documentation on the SproutCore website
for more information.
