CHANGE LOG FOR 1.5
==================

1.5.0.pre.4
-----------

* We are beginning to move API that we don't believe will be ready before 1.5
release into the `experimental` framework. If your apps rely on code that is
migrated to experimental, please make sure you include it as a dependency. For
more, please see frameworks/experimental/README.md.
* Support for extending classes after they've been created with the
reopen()/enhance() combo. For more, see: [this
discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sproutcore-dev/browse_thread/thread/d65ad54d6fddef5d)
	- This change may break existing code if you call sc_super() in your mixins.
	If your app throws exceptions after updating, please see [this post](http://groups.google.com/group/sproutcore-dev/browse_thread/thread/cc6a97e6133cb8cc).
* Added SC.TemplateView and Handlebars. These allow you to specify the content
of your views using templates.
	- {{#view}} helper allows you to define child views
	- {{#bind}} helper allows you to render a property, and automatically update DOM if that
	property ever changes.
	- {{#collection}} helpers allows you to render a simple collection of items
	using templates
	- SC.TextFieldSupport and SC.CheckboxSupport mixins for SC.TemplateViews
	that wrap <input> elements.
* Split SC.View into units of functionality. SC.View remains functionally the
same, but you can now use SC.CoreView, a light-weight subset of SC.View.
* SC.ImageView will use a <canvas> tag on platforms that support it, which
improves performance significantly.
* SC.SegmentedView now creates an overflow menu if there are too many segments
to display.
	- Class names for SC.SegmentedView have been cleaned up. You may need to
	update your CSS if you were theming SC.SegmentedView.
* You can now observe the contents of enumerables using the special `@each`
key.
* Dependent keys can accept property paths. For example, you can say
.property('foo.bar'), and it will be invalidated if the `bar` property of
`foo` changes.
* Deprecated SC.viewportOffset(). Please use SC.offset() instead, which is
more explicit about what it returns.
* SC.browser now detects Android devices.
* SC.device.orientation now works reliably on desktop, iOS, and Android 2.1
and above.
* Experimental support for gyroscope information, if provided by the browser.
* Unit tests for runtime, desktop, foundation, core_foundation, and datastore
are all passing.

BUG FIXES
---------
* XSS security improvements
* Fixed a bug with listItem views not always being removed properly
* Miscellaneous code cleanup, optimizations and fixes
* Fix for memory leak in SC.Response
* Fixed issue with SC.ManyArray not notifying inverse attributes of correct records that got removed in SC.ManyArray#replace, with tests.
* TextField hint was not updating for browsers that support placeholder
* Fix SC.Object so it handles both local and non-local property paths at the same time.
* Fixed SC.Binding.disconnect()
* Initialize the value of the select field view to the value of the first element if there is no emptyName and the value hasn't been previously set.
* Fixed RenderContext to properly handle styles starting with a dash
* Change the value of the textfield on keyDown to reflect key repetitions.
* Ignore moveRight and moveLeft events if the user has a control or meta key held down. Otherwise, we may inadvertently block browser keyboard shortcuts.
* Destroy the layer before removing from parent , otherwise the view will leak
* Fixes to SC.SegmentedView.

* RootResponder's performKeyEquivalent should check the menupane before the keypane.

* Correctly trigger the document's 'ready' event

* Fix for bug in SC.Record.normalize().  It would try to normalize a null child record reference.
* SC.Event.special.mouseover didn't exist, changing it to mouseenter fixes the mouseenter event
* RecordAttribute: Allow null dates
* Checking / Unchecking checkboxes or clicking in empty space was not removing focus from in-focus form fields
* Fixing before ondeactivate in textfield as it is not letting textfields within iframes get focus
* Invalidate the verticalScrollOffset and horizontalScrollOffset with -1 instead of 0, because those are actually valid values.
* Reset the click count if clicks occur too far away from one another
* Make SC.RecordAttribute respect isEditable
