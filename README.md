SproutCore HTML5 Application Framework
======================================
 
SproutCore is a framework for building blazing-fast, desktop-like applications
in the web browser using only native HTML5 features. With SproutCore, you can
build rich, interactive applications in the web in less code than most simple
web pages require today.

The easiest way to get started with SproutCore is using the Abbot build tools
included with the SproutCore package when you install it from the Ruby gem.
Please see the Get Started documentation on the SproutCore website for more
information.
