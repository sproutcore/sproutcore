SproutCore: For Native-Caliber Web Apps
=======

SproutCore is a JS-MVC framework for building blazing-fast, native-caliber web
applications. SproutCore's full-stack approach to single-page application
development gives you the tools you need to build rich, powerful applications...
which happen to run in the browser.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with SproutCore is to install the Ruby gem.
You can find instructions [here](http://sproutcore.com/install/). Once you've
got SproutCore installed, checkout the
[Getting Started](http://guides.sproutcore.com/getting_started.html) tutorial.

## Next Steps

Once you're through the Getting Started tutorial:

- Check out the [Showcase](http://showcase.sproutcore.com/) for demos of a number
  of views and concepts.
- Check out lead developer Tyler Keating's book,
  [SproutCore Web Application Development](http://blog.sproutcore.com/sproutcore-book-available/).
- Check out Juniper, the [web app](http://juniper.dcporter.net/) +

  dive into SproutCore features and best practices in action.
